Room was very neat and clean. Spacious enough for two people. The room service was very good. The location is easily accessible. Good parking space. The buffet breakfast was awesome. But otherwise the food pricing was little costly. Overall, we enjoyed our stay.

Thank you so much. We were really happy with the stay at your hotel. 
All our Bangalore visit till today was at Keys. 
Homely rooms and great service at exceptionally great price. Many thanks, Vinod.

I miss my stay at keys. The staff makes you feel at home. It is probably my best stay possible away from home. A big thanks to all.
